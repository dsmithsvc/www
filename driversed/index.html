                 <p> This online course at Driver's Ed.com is a great way to take your driver's ed <br>
                     training.  You will take the appropriate course for the state where you live.  <br>
                     It is fun, entertaining, and easy.  But more than that, it teaches you the <br>
                     material that you need to know. </p>
                 <p> The cost is $99.00.  If you click on the banner above, you will receive <br>
                     a $10 discount and I will receive a $15 commission.  I took this course as <br>
                     did my older brother.  I enjoyed the experience at my own pace which was <br>
                     much quicker than sitting in a classroom. </p>
                 <p> Thanks for helping me out.</p>
